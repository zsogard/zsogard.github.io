Assignment 1
Zach Sogard
COMP 20
Spring 2016

Every aspect has been implemented correctly. The index.html, bio.html, and resume.html pages have properly validated HTML and CSS. The index.html contains a picture and links to the other two pages. My EECS page, www.ee.tufts.edu/~zsogar01 correctly redirects to zsogard.github.io.

I collaborated with Ben deButts, mainly on how to set up the redirect from tufts to github.

I spent approximately 1 hour on this assignment.
